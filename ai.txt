Did you attempt to make your computer player very smart -- i.e., do something more clever than just pick a random legal move?
Yes I tried to make my computer player smarter

If so, were you able to accomplish this? Is your computer player as smart as you would like?
I couldn't make my computer as smart as I want

How did you determine which piece to play next? Tell us about your “pick next move” algorithm
First computer move have to be next to the first player move in any direction
Second computer move needs to put next to first computer move in any direction so it can make sequence
After second computer's move
If user play move have 4 consecutive stone, computer still need to block the leftover position in certain direction
If computer move have 4 consecutive, computer put stone to make 5 consecutive in certain position
If user play move have 3 consecutive stone, computer need to block either way(2 postions) in certain direction
if computer move have 3 consecutive, computer put stone to make 4 consecutive in certain position
other than that computer tries to put the stone to make most consecutive  

How often did your computer program beat you, or your friends, or whoever tested it out for you?
Since I couldn't accomplish my AI, mostly I won the game

How easy would it be to make the difficulty level adjustable?
To make the diffuculty level adjustable, you have to think which minor part of alogrithm you can takeout
wihtout ruining the game. I think it will be hard. 

How would you improve it in the future?
For now, since my alogrithm only block the first three consecutive move not the later consecutive move, it ruins the future alogrithm steps
In the future I will fix that problem and simplize the code by using recursion or other method. 
To get the best position, it might be better to put points on each direction
